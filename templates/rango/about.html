<h1 class="heading">About us</h1>
<div class="about">
    Our team consists of 3 members, two of us are studying the IT MSc programme and one team member is studying the Computing Science MSc. So, our team has experience from varied backgrounds, which has assisted in making the development of the project more convenient. The web application which has been created will allow users to review their favourite movies. There is a ‘homepage’ which directs users to the main home screen where they can channel their next appropriate steps, view best rated categories and most reviewed films. There is also a ‘category’ dropdown menu which will list the genres of the movies. This will help make the system more structured and tailored towards the users' needs. Furthermore, the application will also have a ‘statistics page’ which will convey the numbers of users, films, and the distribution of the categories via a pie chart. This will assist the users in keeping a log of the statistical figures to track the performance of our website. By implementing these features, we feel our application will be successful in delivering a prime service to our consumers.  <br />
