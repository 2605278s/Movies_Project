Instructions:
Your project should be developed using Python, Django, HTML, CSS and

• the app should involve user authentication;
• it should certainly interact with a new model stored in the database;
• it should be visually appealing and have an intuitive user interface;
• overall the functionality supported should be rich enough in order to allow you to
demonstrate an understanding of the technologies listed above.
